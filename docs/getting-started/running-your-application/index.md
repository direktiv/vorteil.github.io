# Running your own application

In this section we will briefly explain how to create 5 popular types of projects:

- [.NET Core](start-dotnet/)
- [Go (golang)](start-golang/)
- [Java](start-java/)
- [Node.js](start-nodejs/)
- [Python](start-python/)

All of the projects use the pre-defiend application packages available from the [public app repository](https://apps.vorteil.io/). To update an application package simply unpack the package and update the language modules inside the exported project.
